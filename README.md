# Week 4 - CycleGAN Notebook

## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook is designed for the "GAN Getting Started" competition on Kaggle, which focuses on the world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The goal of this competition is to generate new images that closely resemble a provided dataset, using GANs to produce high-quality, realistic images.

## Objectives

This notebook will guide you through:

- Understanding the data and problem statement for the competition.
- Implementing data preprocessing techniques suitable for training GANs.
- Designing, building, and training a CycleGAN model from scratch.
- Evaluating the performance of the generated images based on the competition's criteria.
- Sharing insights, challenges, and potential improvements for GAN models.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
- Experience with TensorFlow and deep learning frameworks.
- Access to a GPU for model training (optional but recommended).
